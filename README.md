> [!TIP]  
> All commands can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/OpticFusion1/MCAntiMalware/wiki)  

## Run
Download a compiled jar or build it from source and then run it using `java -jar MCAntiMalware.jar`
The first step to running MCAntiMalware is obtaining a compiled jar.

You can either download it from [releases](https://github.com/OpticFusion1/MCAntiMalware/releases) or [build](#build) it yourself.

Once you have obtained your MCAntiMalware.jar follow one of the following sets of instructions

<details> 
  <summary>Dedicated Server/Local PC/VPS</summary>
    1. Turn off the server, so the malware is not active.<br>
    2. Upload the MCAntiMalware.jar file to the directory your server jar is in, and then open a shell, command prompt, or terminal in the same directory and run "java -jar MCAntiMalware.jar"<br>
    3. After it's finished scanning, you will find a log in the "AntiMalware/logs" folder. If there are any detected plugins, zip them up and send the zip and log files to me either in a PM on here or on discord<br>
    4. Delete the detected jars, re-download the ones you know are safe and restart the server.<br>

  <summary>Web Panel</summary>
    1. Upload the MCAntiMalware.jar file and rename it to the name the server jar has, and then restart the server.
If this is not possible you will have to instead download the plugins to your own PC, put the plugins and the Anti-Malware jar in the same directory, open a shell, command prompt, or terminal in the same directory, and then run the command "java -jar MCAntiMalware.jar --scanDirectory ."<br>
    2. After it's finished scanning, you will find a log in the "AntiMalware/logs" folder. If there are any detected plugins, zip them up and send the zip and log files to me either in a PM on here or on discord<br>
    3. Delete the detected jars, re-download the ones you know are safe and restart the server after reverting changes made in step 1<br>
