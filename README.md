    3. After it's finished scanning, you will find a log in the "AntiMalware/logs" folder. If there are any detected plugins, zip them up and send the zip and log files to me either in a PM on here or on discord<br>

    1. Upload the MCAntiMalware.jar file and rename it to the name the server jar has, and then restart the server.
If this is not possible you will have to instead download the plugins to your own PC, put the plugins and the Anti-Malware jar in the same directory, open a shell, command prompt, or terminal in the same directory, and then run the command "java -jar MCAntiMalware.jar --scanDirectory ."<br>
