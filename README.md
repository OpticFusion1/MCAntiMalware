# MCAntiMalware
# WARNING: THIS IS NOT A PLUGIN
Anti-Malware for minecraft (only supports spigot plugins for now tho :( )

[SEND]: https://www.spigotmc.org/conversations/add?to=Optic_Fusion1

## Found a Malicious Plugin?
[SEND] the plugin jar to me so I can look through it and add it to this program, then report the plugin.

## How to use

   * Turn the server off so the malware isn't active
   * Upload the MCAntiMalware.jar file to your server directory and run it in a shell, command prompt, or terminal with the command "java -jar MCAntiMalware.jar"
   * After it's finished scanning you'll find a log in the "AntiMalware/logs" folder
   * If there's any detected plugins zip them up and send them to me either here in a PM or on discord
   * Delete the detected jars and re-download ones you know are safe then restart the server
   * If malicious things continue to happen zip up your server jar & plugin jars and send them to me then re-download everything

### Command Line Arguments
Use the --help command line argument to get this information, it will be the most up to date

## Features
* Detects over 200 malicious plugins
* Runs 24/7 for constant protection
* Scans any new jars, rars, or zip files for malicious plugins
* If you use --serverJar <path to server jar> it heavily limits what malicious plugins can do (and even logs which file it was)

## Regarding Premium Plugins
Premium plugins won't be supported because of how Spigot's Anti-Piracy is.

## Why is this Open Source?
Simple, it's java it's easy to deobfuscate and decompile, if someone tried hard enough they'll figure out everything. I'm better off making it open source and getting help from the community.
